# imagify.py

A python script to encode any file as an image.  
These images may be uploaded to Google photos, which offers free unlimited storage for pictures under 16 MP.  

The script will create multiple jpeg-compression resistant photos to encode even the largest backups.  

Keep in mind that temporal and spatial optimization is a work in progress.
